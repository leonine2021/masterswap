## What is Masterswap?

Masterswap is a service that allows users to purchase items with cryptocurrency using their debit card. The service utiliizes 0x's APIs to swap cryptocurrencies from those availble in a customer's wallet to a merchant's expected payment form. Masterswap makes it easy as a one-time approval for a customer to begin spending crypto on daily expenditures.

## How is Masterswap using 0x's APIs

Masterswap allows users to purchase items with any ERC20 tokens in their wallet and leverages 0x's APIs to swap into a merchant's desired payment form. The service uses 0x's GET /quote API to retrieve the best possible swap hops before a purchase, and converts the currencies accordingly.

Masterswap alleviates the complexity of swapping tokens before purchases, giving customers the ability to swipe their cards knowing our service will take care of the rest.

## Adoption & Market

Mastercard handles over 33 billion transactions on a quarterly basis. If a fraction of those payments utilize the cryptocurrency aspect of the card, that would be billions of transactions being routed through the 0x protocol.
